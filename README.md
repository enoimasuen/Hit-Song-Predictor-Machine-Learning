#  Hit Song Predictor: Amapiano & Afrobeats

Can machine learning predict the next Afrobeats or Amapiano hit?  
This project explores whether audio features, streaming data, and metadata can help forecast a song's success in genres that are shaping the global soundscape.

---

##  Overview

This end-to-end machine learning project pulls from the Spotify API, cross-references TikTok virality, Billboard Africa rankings, and daily stream rates to build a predictive model for determining whether a song is likely to be a "hit."

The project is built around two custom classification frameworks â€” one for **Afrobeats** and one for **Amapiano** â€” with different thresholds for virality.

##  Data Sources

-  **Spotify API**: Playlist-level audio features and popularity scores  
-  **Custom Streaming Dataset**: Streams-per-day stats from Nigeria & South Africa charts  
-  **TikTok Viral Flag**: Binary flag (1 = trending, >30K uses)  
-  **Billboard Africa Top 100**: Hit confirmation  
-  **Genre**: Manually tagged as Afrobeats or Amapiano

---

##  Methodology

- **Data Collection & Feature Engineering**
  - Extracted metadata and audio features from Spotify using `Spotipy`
  - Created binary hit labels using custom business logic (see below)
  - Normalized song titles and merged streaming/tiktok/billboard sources

- **Hit Song Labeling Rules**  
  - **Afrobeats** song = hit if it satisfies 3 of:
    - Spotify Popularity â‰¥ 73
    - TikTok viral (â‰¥30k uses)
    - Streams/day â‰¥ 150,000
    - On Billboard Africa charts
  - **Amapiano** song = hit if it satisfies **all 3**:
    - Popularity â‰¥ 65
    - TikTok viral
    - Streams/day â‰¥ 60,000

- **Modeling**
  - Baseline Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest Classifier  
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with feature importance

##  Key Takeaways

- Developed tailored hit-detection frameworks for Afrobeats and Amapiano, combining signals from the Spotify API, TikTok virality, stream velocity, and Billboard Africa rankings.
- Enriched the dataset with audio mood indicators by integrating Spotify audio features and lyrical sentiment scraped from Genius.
- Trained both logistic regression and random forest classifiers with genre-aware thresholds and class weighting, achieving **94% F1-score for Afrobeats** and **92% for Amapiano**.
- Found that Afrobeats hits tend to have **slower tempos**, while Amapiano hits favor **mellow, steady moods** â€” revealing patterns distinct from U.S. pop hit predictors.
- Discovered that TikTok virality was a powerful predictor of Billboard presence, especially when combined with streaming velocity and Spotify popularity metrics.
- Identified danceability, energy, and acousticness as genre-specific drivers of hit probability, with notable divergence between Afrobeats and Amapiano sonic signatures.
